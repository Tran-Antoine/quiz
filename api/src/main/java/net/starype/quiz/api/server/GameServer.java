/**
 * Core object of library. Represents a server with no game logic that listens to game events.
 * <p>
 * All quiz implementations should at least have a {@link QuizGame} object with a server that receives
 * updates from the game via a {@link ServerGate}. A server's purpose should usually be to display
 * information when received, in its own custom way. For the purpose of flexibility, the server is generic
 * thus determines what type of quiz game it works with. Servers should usually never store game instances
 * themselves, since the latter are provided in the event methods that should require them. Ideally, a single server
 * instance should be able to work with as many games of the right type at the same time as needed. All additional
 * game logic should be implemented in the quiz game rather than in the server, since all servers do is perform
 * actions when events occur, such as displaying a question, showing the results of a round, notify players when
 * the game ends, and so on.
 * @param <T> the type of {@link QuizGame} the server works with

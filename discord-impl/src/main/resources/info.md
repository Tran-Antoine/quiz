A Quiz game is made of one or more game round(s), and each round can get you a certain amount of points. The score you obtain depends on several factors:

:small_orange_diamond: The accuracy of your final guess. For instance, if `Albert Einstein` was the correct answer, you might get fewer points if you answer `Einstein` than `Albert Einstein`. If you answered `Chopsticks`, you will obviously not get any points

:small_orange_diamond: Score factors depending on the game round. For instance, some rounds give you more points if you managed to answer before everyone else. Others
give you more points if only a few people managed to get the answer right, etc.

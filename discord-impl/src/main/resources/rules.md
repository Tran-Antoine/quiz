**--| Rules of the game |--**

A Quiz game is made of one or more game round(s), and each round can get you a certain amount of points.
The score you obtain depends on several factors:

:small_orange_diamond: The accuracy of your final guess. For instance, if `Albert Einstein` was the correct answer,
you might get fewer points if you answer `Einstein` than `Albert Einstein`. If you answered `Chopsticks`, you will obviously not get any
 points

:small_orange_diamond: Score factors depending on the game round. For instance, some rounds give you more points if you managed to answer
 before everyone else. Others
give you more points if only a few people managed to get the answer right, etc.

Whenever a question is released, **there is a specific format you must conform to** if you want your guess to be taken into account. Here
 is the format:
`?submit ||my answer||`

It is important that you don't forget the spoilers tag, otherwise everyone will be able to read your answer. Even if the bot deletes the
 answer as soon as it can, the delay makes it easy for other players (even unintentionally) to see what you submitted
